# Text to Segment Anything

## Segment Anything with Text Prompts

**Segment Anything Model (SAM)**  can produce high quality object masks from different types of prompts including points, boxes, masks and text. Unfortunately, the text prompt SAM model is not released. Therefore, we used a combination of **SAM** and **CLIP** to calculate the similarity between the output masks and text prompt. In this way, you can use **text prompt** to segment anything.

## Run the demo

start a gradio service with the following scrip on local machine and you can try out our project with your own images.

```bash
python3 text_sam.py --checkpoint_path ../model/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth model_type vit_h

```
